# Kanit Fonts

Kanit is a formal loopless Thai and Sans Latin typeface. It is a combination of Humanist Sans Serif with a curve of Capsulated Geometric style that suits for various usage presently and futuristically. It was designed to have a 90 degree terminal in order to decrease spacing between each letter, but preserve readability and legibility even in a small point size.  

Kanit means methametics.

The Kanit project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/kanit
