# Kanit Font

Kanit means methametics.

Kanit is a formal loopless Thai and Sans Latin typeface. It is a combination of Humanist Sans Serif with a curve of Capsulated Geometric style that suits for various usage in the present or even in the future. It was designed to have a 90 degree terminal in order to decrease spacing between each letter, but preserve readability and legibility even in a small point size.  

A similarity between some glyphs such as  [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to  take into consideration because it might lead to  confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

Formal loopless Thai tyefaces are simplified from a conservative looped Thai so this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character.

The Kanit project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/kanit
